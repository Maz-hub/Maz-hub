## 👋 Hi, I'm Maz

I'm a self-taught front-end developer learning React — curious, visual, and learning by building.  
By day I work full-time in international sports logistics, and by night I’m coding my way into tech.

- 🔄 Transitioning into tech with hands-on projects and self-paced learning
- ⚛️ Currently learning React, JSX, and component logic
- 🧪 Building small React apps (and rebuilding them!) to cement concepts
- 🧠 Practicing developer thinking: breaking problems into steps and learning to reason through code

- **Backend:** Django models to manage trails, users, and comments
- **Map & Weather:** Mapbox GL JS and Open-Meteo API integration

🗂 I try to keep my learning structured: I write down concepts, revisit often, and always ask "why does this work?"  
🌍 Based in Switzerland, growing through frustration, curiosity, and stubborn consistency
